- hamburger menu
  - account information
- storage project - allows users to group their records by location or project.
  - Example: moving can be in one project and deleted once the move is done.  
    Boxes can be reassigned to a different project or belong to multiple projects
  - Example: storage closet
- storage project \ boxes
  - Scan qrcode or datamatrix code to create box
  - allow any identifier to be used.  Identifiers may be duplicated (as is the 
    case with store bought stickers with pre-printed codes).  Warn that this is a 
    duplicate and allow for additional information to make the identifier unique.
- In-app camera use to take pictures of items in the box.  Pictures are NOT saved to the 
  on device camera roll.
- Allow user to use pictures from the camera roll.
- Future Feature: use AI to create descriptions of items in boxes.  Use case: user is 
  looking for a specific item and types a few search terms and the system displays
  images of box contents that match the search criteria.  This would be a paid use.
